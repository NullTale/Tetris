This folder is not called 'Editor' because we need the editor and runtime classes to be able to interact freely.

It doesn't matter in Unity 2018 or newer because the Assembly Definition file compiles everything into the same assembly, but in earlier versions any folder called 'Editor' would compile its scripts into a separate assembly.
